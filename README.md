### React project template using Redux

#### Description

This is a project template for developing React applications implementing Redux as a main state manager and JS fetch API for data fetching.

#### Project structure

Each visual component has their respective .jsx and .css files in order to associate them easily.

The **Redux** store implementation is located in the store/ directory where the Store.jsx file exports the Provider tag used as a global container inside the App.jsx component render method.

#### Main component

The main view component is located in the components/Data/ directory and is the one that calls the fetch function defined in the services/ directory in order to bring the Pokemon data to the application and render it.
